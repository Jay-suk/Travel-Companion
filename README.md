This web application serves as a travel companion that can be of assistance both before and during a trip! Pulling data from the Places and Maps JavaScript APIs from Google and the [Travel Advisor API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/), "Travel Mate" became one of my most well-rounded projects to date.

I went in hoping to acquire a bit more experience with asynchronous JavaScript and came out having furthered my abilities with React and other vital concepts as well.
